#####About this library:

This library is ESP32 specific and deals with saving to the ESP32's NVM as well as handling file formats.

 Currently the only class that deals with saving and loading to NVM is the SPLIFFSFileManager -  reffered to in this readme as SPLIFFS-FM - has been implemented, which deals exclusively with the flash.

#####One SPLIFFSFileManager To Rule Them All:

Please note, that only a single SPLIFFSFileManager can utilize the filesystem at any given time.

After the currently controlling SPLIFFS-FM has been dismounted, the next must call the mount method

#####Manually mount/dismount:

It was proposed to (dis)mount automatically during the constructor and deconstructor of the SPIFFS-FM class.
This was not implemented, and it is therefore necessary for the programmer to manually mount and dismount the filesystem.

This wasn't implemented, as mounting and dismounting is system wide, and it could therefore cause quite a lot of confusion
and unsuspected errors, which would be hard to pick up on.

#####Error messages

The FS API uses the ESP-IDF native log functions to indicate what caused the error on the serial terminal.
However, the exceptions are thrown inside the wrapper functions we've made.

#####Not Thread Safe

We have yet to make the SPLIFFS-FM object thread safe.
