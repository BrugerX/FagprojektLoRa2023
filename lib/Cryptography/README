Benjamin has been the main person responsible for this library.

#####About this library:

This library deals with everything related to cryptography.

#####Error handling:

In case of failed or unexpected errors from functions facing the user of this API, we throw errors as well as print the specific error codes of the given error.
We do this because of the unique and important role cryptography has in keeping the device safe.

Some of these errors are defined in CryptographicSettings.h others are defined in the different MbedTLS libraries we've used to create this library.
Currently, there is no way to distinguish between the two, and it is up to the programmer to figure out where the error code came from.

However this should be easy, as the majority of the error codes from the MbedTLS library can be found in their documents.

#####Undocumented error codes:

Errors that are apparently not documented typically stem from the MbedTLS library.

#####Success == 0:

The MbedTLS libraries typically uses 0 as the value for success and the specific error code for failures.

We've therefore defined the macros RSABooleanTrue and RSABooleanFalse to designate success of an operation in the Cryptography library.

In other words: It is important that a future developer does not check the success of an MbedTLS API call by using:
result == True
