#####About this library:

This library is ESP32 specific and deals with saving to the ESP32's NVM

- currently only the SPLIFFSFileManager - sometimes reffered to in this readme as SPLIFFS-FM - has been implemented, which deals exclusively with the flash.

#####One SPLIFFSFileManager To Rule Them All:

Please note, that only a single SPLIFFSFileManager can utilize the filesystem at any given time.

After the currently controlling SPLIFFS-FM has been dismounted, the next must call the mount method

#####Manually mount/dismount:

It was proposed to (dis)mount automatically during the constructor and deconstructor of the SPIFFS-FM class.
This was not implemented, and it is therefore necessary for the programmer to manually mount and dismount the filesystem.

This wasn't implemented, as mounting and dismounting is system wide, and it could therefore cause quite a lot of confusion
and unsuspected errors, which would be hard to pick up on.
