Bjarke has been the main person responsible for developing this library

This is our library for the MVC architecture.

This is used for the GUI, so we can have the data in the DataModel be displayed on the display.
The features included in this is a start screen, a compass, which can draw members position on the compass as well (if they are known).
Furthermore, there is also a table that can show the members ID as well as their last timestamp, (if this is known).
Last but not least, on the table you can also pick a specific member and see more data about them, and choose if they should be highlighted on the compass.
